This is a space where I begin building upon my python skills using automatetheboringstuff textbook. I will be updating all the projects that I personally think would 
be interesting from just reading the book, alongside with all the practice projects inside of the book as well. I am creating this to see how much exactly my coding 
would improve overtime, and how alot of my previous coding could be further optimized. When following alongside the projects I write, I just follow the prompt, and 
write my own code after reading the sections. Thanks for looking at my coding progression!
